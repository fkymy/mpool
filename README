              mpool : A Memory Allocation Pool

mpool is a simple memory allocation pool. It speeds up programs
that needs many system calls for allocating small memory blocks.
For example, it is useful for large tree structures that requires
making a system call with malloc each time a new node is added.

It also allows semi-automatic memory management. There is no need
to traverse your data structures to free all of their memory, since
the memory blocks are separately managed by mpool.

mpool works by creating a subpool with a large chunk of memory block,
which is given out in smaller chunks as requested. When a request
exceeds the size of a subpool (a miss), it creates a new subpool
twice the size of the previous subpool. A subpool with too many misses
is no longer used for subsequent requests.

There is a thread safety option, but it is not tested well enough.
